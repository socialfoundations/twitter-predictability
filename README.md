# Tweet Predictability

We wish to measure the information content of users' tweets and the shared information between Twitter users and their social circles.
This project was inspired by previous work from Bagrow et al. (2019, http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04575), where they show that people’s future tweets can be successfully predicted using their social circle’s past tweets. 
Our goal is to test their results empirically with Large Language Models.
