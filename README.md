# Twitter information flow

Inspired by previous work from Bagrow et al. (2019, http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04575) we wish to measure the information flow between Twitter users and their social circles.
They show that people’s future tweets can be successfully predicted using their social circle’s past tweets. 
Our goal would be to reproduce their results empirically with concrete predictors (Large Language Models) finetuned on Twitter data.
